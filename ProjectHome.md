SpyOnMe is a tiny python script that takes screenshots in predefined interval and saves them in predefined directory.

Screenshots are identified by timestamp (f.e. 10-03-25\_10:33:57.jpg).

This is in early stage of development but **I dont work on it anymore** as I lost a motivation. Thougt basic functionality is there and working. Contact me if you are interesting in this tool...

Intended for and tested on Linux.
